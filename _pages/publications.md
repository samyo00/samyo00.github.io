<b>1. OBoctNet: Enhancing Ophthalmic Biomarker Detection through Active Learning and Explainable AI in Radiological Analysis</b><br>

<b>Submitted to:</b> Cognitive Computation (Springer, Q1)<br>
<b>Status:</b> Under Review<br>
<b>Description:</b> This paper, an extension of my undergraduate thesis, introduces a novel two-stage training strategy for enhancing ophthalmic biomarker identification in OCT scans using the OLIVES dataset, which contains only 12% labeled data. By leveraging the OBoctNet model with active learning and GradCAM for interpretability, the approach significantly improves diagnostic accuracy, achieving a remarkable 23% performance increase across 50% of biomarkers compared to prior studies.
