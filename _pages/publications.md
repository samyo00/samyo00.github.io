<b>1. OBoctNet: Enhancing Ophthalmic Biomarker Detection through Active Learning and Explainable AI in Radiological Analysis</b><br>

<b>Submitted to:</b> Cognitive Computation (Springer, Q1)<br>
<b>Status:</b> Under Review<br>
<b>Description:</b> This paper, an extension of my undergrad thesis, presents OBoctNet, a model using active learning and GradCAM to enhance biomarker detection in OCT scans. Leveraging labeled and unlabeled data from the OLIVES dataset, it achieves a 23% improvement in accuracy across 50% of biomarkers compared to previous studies.
