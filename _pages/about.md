Welcome! I’m <b>Samya Acharja</b>, a Computer Science graduate and research assistant at the <b>Health and Informatics Research Lab (HIRL)</b>, where I focus on the intersection of <b>AI and healthcare</b>. My work revolves around <b>medical imaging</b>, using <b>deep learning</b> to improve radiological accuracy and speed up disease detection. I’m passionate about developing <b>transparent, interpretable AI models</b> that clinicians can rely on for better decision-making.

I’ve led projects on <b>ophthalmic biomarker detection</b> using self-supervised learning and am currently exploring <b>Graph Neural Networks</b> to effectively find the region of interest for classifying tolerant and intolerant cases in MRI analysis. My experience also spans <b>Vision Transformers</b> and <b>contrastive learning</b> to refine diagnostics, along with retinal vessel segmentation using <b>UNET</b>.

During my undergrad, I excelled in programming competitions, sharpening my problem-solving skills as a <b>judge and problem setter</b>.

In my free time, I’m a huge <b>Real Madrid</b> fan and love <b>photography</b>—it’s my creative escape.
