Welcome ! I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Marquette University, where I also work as a Research Assistant. My research focuses on the intersection of Geospatial AI and data systems, with an emphasis on learned cardinality estimation. In simple terms, I work on teaching databases to make smarter predictions so they can answer questions more efficiently.

In my free time, I’m a huge <b>Real Madrid</b> fan and love <b>photography</b>—it’s my creative escape.
