Welcome! I’m <b>Samya Acharja</b>, a Computer Science graduate and research assistant at the <b>Health and Informatics Research Lab (HIRL)</b>, where I focus on the intersection of <b>AI and healthcare</b>. My work revolves around <b>medical imaging</b>, using <b>deep learning</b> to improve radiological accuracy and speed up disease detection. I’m passionate about developing <b>transparent, interpretable AI models</b> that clinicians can rely on for better decision-making.

I’ve led projects on <b>ophthalmic biomarker detection</b> using self-supervised learning and explored <b>Graph Neural Networks</b> for identifying regions of interest in MRI analysis. My experience spans <b>Vision Transformers</b> and leveraging <b>contrastive learning</b> to uncover key features in OCT scans, driving more accurate and insightful diagnostics. Additionally, I am currently working on integrating superpixel-based graph representations with GNNs for medical image segmentation, focusing on polyp detection.

I’m fortunate to work under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Uq3O034AAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Zahid Hasan</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=JnwcUwkAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Mohammad Ali Moni</a>, whose guidance has been instrumental in shaping my research journey.

During my undergrad, I excelled in programming competitions, sharpening my problem-solving skills as a <b>judge and problem setter</b>.

In my free time, I’m a huge <b>Real Madrid</b> fan and love <b>photography</b>—it’s my creative escape.
